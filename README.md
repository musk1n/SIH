## 🧠 Core Features
### Price Prediction Models

- 📈 SARIMAX: Considers wholesale price and seasonality.

- 🧠 GRU Neural Network: Best-performing model (MSE: 1.3) for short-term predictions.

- Other models explored: LSTM, RNN, SARIMA (not selected due to higher MSE).

### Interactive Dashboards

- Trend visualizations across states & crops

- News-backed price outlier explanations

### Innovations

- 📊 Game Theory based Demand-Supply Modelling

- 🌐 Multilingual Chatbot with price forecasts, news analysis & buffer stock info

- 🗺️ Geographical Heatmaps: Mean & Std price visualization on India's map

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Backend: Django, Python

- AI/ML: GRU, SARIMAX, NLP, RNN, LSTM

- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Langchain, Flowise

- Automation: Selenium
